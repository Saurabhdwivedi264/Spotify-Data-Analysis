# Data Analysis

- The dataset has been analyzed/visualized using Machine Learning Python Libraries.

- The Spotify data was taken from kaggle and use to analyze in different ways using python libraries.

- The dataset contains different songs and their attributes such as release date, Singer's names, Popularity, Song's Durations, etc.

- I have tried to analyze/visualize the dataset using different python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and seaborn as well as from statistical and graphical views.

- The Dataset used is uploaded with the detailed analysis.

## Datasets

## Modules Used

- ### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

- ### Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

- ### MatPlotLib (PyPlot)
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

- ### SeaBorn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install difflib.
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
pip install seaborn
```

## Usage
```python
### import the required libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
